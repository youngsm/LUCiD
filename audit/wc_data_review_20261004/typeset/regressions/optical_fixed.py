"""Per-photon optical model — the single, testable λ → optical-property seam.

``evaluate_optical_model`` maps per-photon wavelengths to the per-photon optical
lengths (Rayleigh scatter, Mie scatter, absorption) and QE weight that the photon
transport step consumes. It is a **pure** function of ``(DetectorParams, wavelengths,
MediumProperties)`` — all λ-sampling lives upstream (the source / simulator), so the
model only ever *evaluates* at the wavelengths it is handed.

Two regimes, one return type (:class:`OpticalArrays`):

- ``wavelengths is None`` — monochromatic / scalar mode: broadcast the (fittable)
  ``DetectorParams`` optical scalars to all photons. QE weight is ``None`` (the scalar
  QE enters in ``make_hits``).
- ``wavelengths`` an ``(n,)`` array — wavelength mode: evaluate the medium reference
  curves at each photon's λ (``length = 1 / coeff(λ)``) and, if a ``qe_fn`` is given,
  the per-photon QE weight ``qe_fn(λ)``.

The design target is one decomposition
``prop(λ) = reference(λ) · deviation(λ; DetectorParams)`` where the reference is fixed
medium physics and the deviation is the fittable curve. This module is that seam; the
deviation layer is added on top of it without changing this contract (deviation ≡ 1
reproduces the medium reference exactly).

    Parameters
    ----------
    detector_params : DetectorParams
        Nested pytree; the scattering/absorption sub-tuples supply the scalar
        optical lengths used in monochromatic mode.
    wavelengths : jnp.ndarray or None
        Per-photon wavelengths (nm), shape ``(n_photons,)``. ``None`` selects the
        scalar (monochromatic) mode.
    medium : MediumProperties
        Medium reference curves. Must carry ``wavelength_grid`` and the
        ``*_coeff`` arrays when ``wavelengths`` is not ``None``.
    n_photons : int
        Number of photons (used to broadcast scalars in monochromatic mode).
    qe_fn : callable, optional
        ``qe_fn(λ) -> qe_fraction``. Applied per-photon in wavelength mode only.
    control_lambda : sequence of float
        Control wavelengths (nm) anchoring the DetectorParams λ-deviation curves.
        Defaults to :data:`CONTROL_WAVELENGTHS_NM`.

    Notes
    -----
    In wavelength mode every optical length is the fixed medium reference scaled
    by a fittable multiplicative deviation:
    ``length(λ) = (1 / coeff_ref(λ)) / interp(λ, control_λ, dev_curve)``. The
    deviation curves are DetectorParams leaves (``scattering.rayleigh_dev`` /
    ``scattering.mie_dev`` / ``absorption.abs_dev`` / ``response.qe_dev``); an
    all-ones curve gives ``dev ≡ 1`` and reproduces the pure medium reference
    exactly. Monochromatic mode (``wavelengths is None``) uses the scalar fields
    and ignores the deviation curves.
