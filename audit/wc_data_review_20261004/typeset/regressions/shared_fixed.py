"""The surface photon propagator: one factory for any Detector subclass.

Geometry enters only through the Detector methods called below (configure_grid,
assign_sensor_to_cells, grid_cell_centers, build_inverted_sensor_map, bounds_check,
intersect_ray, point_to_grid_cell, compute_normal); everything else here is shape-agnostic.

Not the only propagator: `lucid/propagation/string/` traverses a per-DOM volume rather than a
surface grid, and carries its own deposit implementation. The two have diverged: that one clamps
the closest-approach parameter where this one gates on it, and has no first-hit survival product.

def first_hit_survival(weights, times):
    """Cap the deposit at one photon: P(hit s_i) = p_i * prod_{j before i} (1 - p_j).

    `overlap_prob` is applied INDEPENDENTLY per candidate, so on its own it leaves the total uncapped:
    at grazing incidence a ray skimming the wall passes within r of a whole row of sensors and each
    takes full weight. Physically the photon
    deposits on the FIRST sensor it reaches, so with candidates ordered by arrival time and p_i the
    conditional hit probability given the photon gets there, sum(P) = 1 - prod(1 - p_j) <= 1.
    It splits weight smoothly between adjacent sensors (p1, p2*(1-p1)) and reduces to p_1 when
    only one candidate is in range. Done in log space; gated-out candidates have p = 0 and
    contribute exactly 1 to the product.

    TIES ARE BROKEN BY SLOT. Two live candidates can arrive at EXACTLY the same time -- a ray
    equidistant from two sensors -- and with a strict `t_j < t_i` neither counts as earlier, both
    keep their full p, and the sum can exceed 1. The slot index orders them, so the cap holds by construction rather than almost always.

    THE ORDERING IS A HARD COMPARISON. The product is smooth in the p's, but which p's multiply
    which is decided by a threshold on arrival time, so when two candidates swap order the
    per-sensor split jumps while the total stays put. Aggregate checks cannot see it; a
    per-sensor gradient can.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights : (C, N) per-candidate overlap probabilities
    times : (C, N) per-candidate arrival times

    Returns
    -------
    (C, N) capped weights, summing to at most 1 over C for every photon.

        sensor radius of sensors displaced along the wall from the landing point, over-counting
